# The keyword 'ensure' is a section of code that is going to run no matter what, its going to run if we have
# a valid execution in our 'begin' section or if we have something 'rescued' as well.
#
# It's basically a chunk of code to run no matter what at the end of the method. And in the real-world the 'ensure'
# its mostly used in a 'cleanup operation'.

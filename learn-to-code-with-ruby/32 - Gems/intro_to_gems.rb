# Gems
# A gem is an add-on, an extension or expansion for Ruby.
# It´s a bundle of regular Ruby code, i.e, classes, modules, methods
# that other developers have written and published for us to use.
# This reduce the amount of code that we have to write.

# Gems exist to solve problems in a specific domain, or a specific
# field of endeavor that other developers are likely to benefit from.

# It's important to notice the Ruby on Rails is a gem that solves the problem
# of building a back end: it´s a web development framework for building a website.

# There are gems for specialized topics, a specialized Ruby code that a
# developer or a company has written that they thought would be valuable
# to release publicly online, so other developers can download it and use it themselves;

# visit rubygems.org

# Examples of gems: faker, finance, rails, et.

# Dependecies
# A dependency is something that a gem depends on in order to work,
# i.e, just another gem. Gems can rely in another gem.


# How can we acess and use the gem package manager that comes pre-installed with Ruby?
# The 'gem' software program is what we use to fetch and download a ruby gem from the ruby gem´s servers;
# On the terminal, we can run these commands
      # To verify if the gem program is installed: $ gem -v
      # To update the gem software itself to the latest version: $ gem update --system
      #

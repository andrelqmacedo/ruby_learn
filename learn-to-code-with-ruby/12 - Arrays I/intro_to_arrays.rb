# An array is an ordered list of objects, ordered sequence of items
#
# Arrays are created with a pair of square brackts
#
# We often use the word "elements" to describe the itens
#inside the array
#
# The array itself is an object.
# Think of a box in the real world
# A box can hold multiple itens inside of it.
# The box is an object and the items inside of ir are objects as well

# Typically with arrays, we´ll use the 'p' method, 'cause the 'puts' method will only print the elements

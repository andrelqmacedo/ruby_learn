# There are 3 ways to use the 'super' keyword:
#
# 1) Without parentheses, 'super' passes ALL subclass method's arguments
#       to the superclass's method.,
#
# 2) With parentheses and no argumet, 'super' passes no arguments
#       to the superclassÂ´s methods
#
# 3) With parentheses and arguments, 'super' passes those arguments
#       to the superclass's methods.

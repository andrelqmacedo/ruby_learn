# How to extract a value from a hash using it's key?
# The syntax is exactly the same as pulling out an element from an array with its index position, by using a pair
# of square brackets []. The difference is that in an array the index position is automatically implicitly generated.
# With hashes, our keys are chosen by us, so the extraction identifiers habve been chosen by us.

p nfl_roster_salaries["Patrick Mahomes"]

# The value is referenced not by its position, not by the idea of order (like an array), but by a key, an identifier.
# The key must be unique!
# We can use two equal keys inside a hash, but that will raise a warning, and the final value will overwrite
# the first one. But we dont want duplicate keys in a hash.

p nfl_roster_salaries["Joe Burrow"]
p nfl_roster["Los Angeles Rams"]

# If we try to extract a key that doesn't not exit will get a nil object.
p nfl_roster_salaries["Tom Brady"]

# Atention to the case sensitiveness of Ruby, we have to write the key out exactly as it is;

# Fetch method - allows as to pull out a value by it's key:
p nfl_roster_salaries.fetch("Josh Allen")

# But, different from the square brackets, if we use the fetch method to try to pull a value from a key that doesn't
# exist, we're going to get a Ruby exception.

# Otherwise, the fetch method accepts a second argument, that represents the fallback/default value, to provide in the
# scenario that that key does not exist:
p nfl_roster_salaries.fetch("Josh Nonsense", 0)
# WeÂ´re only going to fallback to the value passed as second argument, if the key does not exist;

# My Ruby Studies

This repository contains my studies of the Ruby language. Here, I share my codes, notes, and other materials that help me learn Ruby. The divisions and early studies of the repository were made based on the course "Learn to Code with Ruby" by Boris Paskhaver (https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-code-with-ruby-lang/)

# What you will find here:
Example codes of basic Ruby concepts, such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, classes, modules, and inheritance.
Notes on some advanced Ruby concepts, such as modules, mixins, and testing.
